/usr/bin/bash: line 2: rclone: command not found

Error in rule send_cram_to_storage:

    output: rclone_archive_crams.ok
    log: logs/cramToStorage.log (check log file(s) for error message)

Shutting down, this might take some time.
Exiting because a job execution failed. Look above for error message
